# Simple-Binary-Classification
In this repository we can find the development of a binary classification problem with machine learning, we use the Sonar database (Mines vs Rocks) for which we implement different methods including SVM, KNN, logistic regression and others. We compare the methods with cross-validation in order to decide which method best fits the data.  For the development of the above we present a Jupyter notebook that runs the Julia Kernel 1.7.2 and we extensively use the ScikitLearn library.

The database can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)

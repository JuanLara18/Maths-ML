# Math of Machine Learning in Julia 

This repository contains a course project for "Mathematics of Machine Learning" developed in the Julia language. The project consists of three main folders, each focused on a different aspect of machine learning.

## 1 Least Squares
This folder contains a demonstration of the least squares method, including the solution to the Point Set Registration problem. The focus of this folder is on the mathematical foundations of machine learning.

## 2 Binary Classification
This folder contains a practical application of machine learning using the Mines vs Rocks dataset. The goal is to classify the data into two categories using various machine learning models, including SVM, KNN, logistic regression, and others. The models are compared using various metrics to determine the best approach.

## 3 Stochastic Gradient Descent
This folder contains a theoretical development of stochastic gradient descent and its use in deep neural networks. The focus of this folder is on understanding why the optimization problem solution works in deep neural networks.

## 4 Learning From Data

This folder contains answers to some of the introductory questions about statistical learning theory found in the book "Learning From Data" by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa. The focus of this folder is on gaining a deeper understanding of the theory behind machine learning.
